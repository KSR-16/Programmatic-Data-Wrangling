# Programmatic-Data-Wrangling

Performing Exploratory Data Analysis and draw insights from movie dataset.

Task is to freely explore the data & draw insights from it. The following outcomes are expected: 

3 Python visualisations showcasing insights drawn from the data

2 keypoints drawn from the data - explicitly stated in Markdown format and explained by your code & findings. What did you find most interesting? Or most surprising? Why is that?

Select 2 movies on which to provide a more in-depth single observation analysis. Why have you selected these two? What's interesting about them? How do they compare to similar movies?

### Correlation Heatmap

There is a relationship with having a larger budget to improve the chances of achieving commercial and financial success as indicated by the Revenue, Popularity and vote count. This is in contrast with the voting average (rating) as the relationship is basically non-existent. The critical success and the quality of the film isn't dependant on the amount of budget they have to create it. What does help how the film is received by critics and cinephiles, is the runtime. These are movies that are mainly created by the top directors. They have a loyal following who prefer enjoying a cinema experience that is longer than 2 hours and have more sway with demanding a runtime that is suitable for their creative needs.

### Distribution Plot

This plot was created to view the quantity of votes submitted depending on the score given for 4765 films. The visual shows outliers in the data as there are 50 films with a score of 0 and 3 films revieved a perfect 10 which needed further investigation. Expected to see a more symetrical distribution with the voting average however films that scored 8 was lower than expected.

### Bar Chart

This is a visual to look at the release year of the 4765 films by seperating them into decades bins. The majority of films in this database were released in the 2000s as there was a positive trend from the previous decades. Suprised that there wasn't another increase into the 2010s which may indicate the datset was compiled before the end of that decade. Classic films are regarded as being released before the 1990s and are not represented fully which can affect the conclusions and insights gathered from analysis.
