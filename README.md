Performing Exploratory Data Analysis and draw insights from movie dataset.

Task is to freely explore the data & draw insights from it. The following outcomes are expected: 

3 Python visualisations showcasing insights drawn from the data

2 keypoints drawn from the data - explicitly stated in Markdown format and explained by your code & findings. What did you find most interesting? Or most surprising? Why is that?

Select 2 movies on which to provide a more in-depth single observation analysis. Why have you selected these two? What's interesting about them? How do they compare to similar movies?
